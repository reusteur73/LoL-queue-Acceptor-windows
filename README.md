# v1.6.0 What's new ?
- Instead of py2exe i used pyinstaller to compile program.
- Now python3.10 is used insted of 3.6.
- The code is much more efficient, before it fears 400 lines, now it is optimized and makes 200 lines for the same actions. [See code](https://github.com/reusteur73/Python_auto_queue_acceptor_uncompiled/blob/main/accept.py)
- Improvement of interfaces.

# LoL-queue-Acceptor-windows
A League Of Legends queue acceptor for windows including .exe file - No installation needed, ready to use. <br>
You can set a notifier on telegram or discord or none.

# Ready to use match accept League Of Legends.
I was inspired by the lucassmonn code
[accept-queue-lol-telegram](https://github.com/lucassmonn/accept-queue-lol-telegram), and I modify it according to my needs. That I have compiled in order to make it accessible to everyone.

You can use uncompiled version, where you can find the code open to all, check [python version](https://github.com/reusteur73/Python_auto_queue_acceptor_uncompiled/blob/main/accept.py) (uncompiled) for other OS. (But you would need to install all the right packages in the right versions.)
# Antivirus detection

I used pyinstaller to compile the program.
Antivirus programs can mark programs compiled with pyinstaller as viruses. Normally no, but it can be the case.
I advise you to add an exception to windows defender and your antivirus if needed.  
As said above, the uncompiled version is available, the code open to all

# How to use

 # How To setup Accept Match button

## - Screenshot

Launch a game of LoL, during the queue launch the Windows Screenshot Tool application, or press Win+Shift+S. <br>
When the match appears, take a picture of the 'accept' button text. <br>Like below :

<img src="https://github.com/reusteur73/Python-queue-Acceptor-LoL-compiled/blob/1.5.2/docs/exemple1.PNG"width="500"/>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><sup>Here is an example with almost all languages, yours will probably be in English</sup></p>
When you have made the photo, you can not accept the match in order to continue.<br>
You can save the image wherever you want. Then go to the file where you saved the image and follow these steps:<br>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/reusteur73/Python-queue-Acceptor-LoL-compiled/blob/1.5.2/docs/exemple2.gif" alt="drawing" width="500" style="text-align: center;"/>
</p>
<p style="align: center;"><sup>Create a shortcut to the image, right-click the shortcut, so you can copy the target location of the image. You can then delete the shortcut.</sup></p>

<p align="center">You can now paste the path to the image (by right-clicking) into the script window, when asked. <br>Like below:</p>
